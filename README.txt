OpenAPI (fka. Swagger) Document Generator for WordPress REST API

== Description ==

This plugin reads the schema definition of a given WordPress REST Api namespace and transforms it to a
OpenAPI document. The generator itself is exposed via the WordPress REST Api with the namespace 
document-generator-for-openapi/v1.

Generate a document by calling /wp-json/document-generator-for-openapi/v1/document?namespace=\<NAMESPACE\>. It will return the OpenAPI document.

=== Limitations ===
* Beware that currently the generator is exposeed to anonymous users since the WordPress schema endpoint is also publicly 
available.
* No UI for configuration yet
* Currently only version 3.1.0 of the OpenAPI specification is implemented. Swagger tools for 3.0.0 might work though.
* Extensibility with hooks needs to be improved


== Installation ==

1. Install plugin via WordPress Plugin repository or by manually copying files
2. Activate the plugin
3. Access the REST Api of the generator by calling /wp-json/document-generator-for-openapi/v1/document?namespace=\<NAMESPACE\> and your OpenAPI document will be returned.
